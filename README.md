# Hand-Movement-Classification-based-on-EMG-Signals-using-Machine-learning-and-Deep-learning

## Project Implementation
Our project was executed in two primary ways: machine learning and deep learning. Each 
pathway made a distinct contribution to our study. Upon completing the implementation, we could 
thoroughly analyse the outcomes and draw conclusions regarding which approach best complemented 
our study and yielded the most accurate results.

The overall process started with the EMG data collected from the MYO Thalmic bracelet. 
Where, each class data was recorded. Then our EMG data were processed using different methods. 
Features were extracted using various functions, and lastly, data was fed to the different ML & DL
classifiers for evaluation and testing.

The whole process including preprocessing, feature extraction, and testing was implemented 
using Python. Python was a great option due to its large sets of libraries, such as the Numpy, Pandas, 
and Matplotlib used in our machine learning experiment.


## EMG dataset:
Obtaining raw data can be very difficult and time-consuming. Fortunately, in our study, we 
were lucky enough to be shared with analytics-ready data that we can utilize effectively. To record the 
signals MYO Thalmic bracelet was used, it is designed to be worn on the userâ€™s forearm, next to a PC 
with a Bluetooth receiver (Sojan, 2020). This armband is designed with no less than 8 sensors 
surrounding the forearm that can capture the myographic signals. Soon to be transferred to the PC 
through the Bluetooth interface.


In our research, the EMG data provided was mined from 36 subjects. Every subject was asked 
to perform several static hand gestures for two rounds. Each round held six-seven basic gestures that 
can be characterised as hand in rest, hand clenched in a fist, wrist flexion, wrist extension, radial 
deviation, ulnar deviation, and extended palm (not performed by all subjects). Every gesture was 
carried out for 3 seconds along with a 3 seconds pause gap in between gestures (Sojan, 2020). Our 
dataset consisted of 11 columns, with the first column representing time in milliseconds (ms), followed 
by columns 2-8 representing the channels (EMG channels of MYO Thalmic armband), column 10 
denoting label of gestures, and lastly, the label column referring to the subject who took over the 
gesture.


## Machine Learning-Based Classification:

We settled on 4 different supervised ML classifiers that could perform well in terms of gesture 
classification. The Support-vector machine, k-nearest Neighbours Algorithm, Decision Tree, and 
Random Forest. These classifiers were preferred for comparison, based on several performance metrics 
such as accuracy, and precision.

SVM is one of the algorithms that is frequently preferred for classification use, such as body 
movements, images, texts and handwriting, time series, and medical predictions. (Toledo-Perez et al., 
2019). It is a branch of supervised learning algorithms, that helps in minimizing structural risk and 
includes statistical learning theories (SENTURK & BAKAY, 2021). SVM mainly works by finding an 
optimal hyperplane that is separated into a highly-dimensional feature space. (Kaczmarek et al., 2019) 
This can be achieved by mapping entries using non-linear functions. This allows SVM to effectively 
differentiate between two or more types of objects. Also, SVM offers several Kernels that are 
exponential, radial, and polynomial functions. Its ability to handle non-linear functions through Kernel 
functions makes it easy to capture complex patterns in EMG data. For EMG hand gesture 
classification, polynomial is one suitable function used as Kernel.

k-NN is also a supervised learning algorithm that is widely used for classification and 
regression functions. It functions based on the principle of similarity where neighbours have 
contributions based on their distance. The most essential parameter stands to be the k, which holds the 
value of the number of neighbours (SENTURK & BAKAY, 2021). Its mechanism revolves around 
calculating the distance between the test sample and the training sample and then choosing the knearest training samples to the test samples, then finally classifying them into the class with the highest probability (AlOmari & Liu, 2014). It is common to find k-NN algorithms in the fields of pattern recognition, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and image and text classification. Lastly, KNN provides a fluent non-parametric process for assigning class labels to input patterns based on the 
class labels represented by the k (Rasheed et al., 2006).
